# FashionMNIST-Image-Classifier
This is a mini project I worked on using PyTorch. The goal was to build a CNN model that can classify grayscale images from the FashionMNIST dataset into 10 categories like T-shirt, Trouser, Sneaker, etc.

# Overview

- Built a CNN using PyTorch

- Used FashionMNIST for training and testing

- Visualized sample predictions

- Plotted a confusion matrix for evaluation

# Libraries Used

- torch

- torchvision

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- scikit-learn

# Output

- Printed training loss for each epoch

- Final test accuracy: 90.06%

- Showed some sample predictions with labels

- Plotted a confusion matrix to see class-wise performance
